On this page, we get you up and running with Error monitoring's package, so that it will automatically report errors and exceptions in your application.

Don't already have an account and Error monitoring project established? Head over to error-monitoring.vercel.app, then return to this page.

## Install

```bash
# Using npm
npm i @error-monitoring/package
# Using yarn
yarn add @error-monitoring/package
```

## Configure

Configuration should happen as early as possible in your application's lifecycle.

```jsx
import React from "react";
import ReactDOM from "react-dom";
import Error from "@error-monitoring/package";
import App from "./App";

const error = new Error({
  projectId: "d284062f-33f0-40cb-539b-178c01fe318c",
  env: "development",
});

error.initial();

ReactDOM.render(<App />, document.getElementById("root"));
```
